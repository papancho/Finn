# Finn

Finn is a financial expense application aimed at modernizing the way employees and employers manage employee expenses.

With Finn, employees can submit expenses and view the status of their expense approval in real time. Employees can link Finn with major financial institutions, so when expenses come back, they can credit the money from the app directly to their financial institution of choice. No more waiting for a cheque or the next payday!

This project only contains the employee UX for Finn. An employer UX is soon to follow, allowing for employers to approve the expenses and provide financial credits.

# Important
Finn is currently a Proof of Concept. Finn is not yet fully functional, and is not currently linked to any financial institutions. Please bear with us as we continue to develop - third year university is a killer XD
